VXLAN
Use in-kernel VXLAN to encapsulate the packets.

Type and options:

Type (string): vxlan
VNI (number): VXLAN Identifier (VNI) to be used. Defaults to 1.
Port (number): UDP port to use for sending encapsulated packets. Defaults to kernel default, currently 8472.
GBP (Boolean): Enable VXLAN Group Based Policy. Defaults to false.
DirectRouting (Boolean): Enable direct routes (like host-gw) when the hosts are on the same subnet. VXLAN will only be used to encapsulate packets to hosts on different subnets. Defaults to false.
host-gw
Use host-gw to create IP routes to subnets via remote machine IPs. Requires direct layer2 connectivity between hosts running flannel.

host-gw provides good performance, with few dependencies, and easy set up.

Type:

Type (string): host-gw
UDP
Use UDP only for debugging if your network and kernel prevent you from using VXLAN or host-gw.

Type and options:

Type (string): udp
Port (number): UDP port to use for sending encapsulated packets. Defaults to 8285.
