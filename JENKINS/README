BUILD_ID

The current build id, such as "2005-08-22_23-59-59" (YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss, defunct since version 1.597)

BUILD_NUMBER

The current build number, such as "153"

BUILD_TAG

String of jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}. Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.

BUILD_URL

The URL where the results of this build can be found (e.g. http://buildserver/jenkins/job/MyJobName/666/)

CVS_BRANCH

For CVS-based projects, this variable contains the branch of the module. If CVS is configured to check out the trunk, this environment variable will not be set.

EXECUTOR_NUMBER

The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) that's carrying out this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1.

GIT_BRANCH

For Git-based projects, this variable contains the Git branch that was checked out for the build (normally origin/master)
